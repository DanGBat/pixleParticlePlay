WORKING TILE: PIXLE PARTICLE PLAY

This is a very inventive little visual effect based program which
tracks the movement of the mouse pointer using an 'EventListener'.

As the mouse moves over the loaded image, it's pixels/particles
are displaced around an invisible sphere, the pixels/particles
then return quite poetically to their original positions as the
mouse pointer moves on.

A particular interesting part of this project was having
to convert the background image into BASE64 so that the
data from the image can be interpreted by the code.
